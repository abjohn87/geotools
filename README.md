## Installation

Currently, the geotools require Python 3 and associated libraries like numpy, rasterio, ee, geemap etc. Specific dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. The easiest way to install the dependencies is to use conda. If you don't have conda installed, you can download and install it from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). After installing conda, [check this repository](https://github.com/opengeos/python-geospatial) to install required dependencies.

Clone the repository and install requirements:

```git
git clone https://github.com/waleedgeo/geotools.
```

Then you can open each jupyter noteebook in the scripts directory and run the code
